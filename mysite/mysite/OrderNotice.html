	<h1>Ordering Notice</h1>

	<p>Dear {{ person_name }},</p>

	<p>Thanks for placing an order from {{ company }}. 
		It's scheduled to ship on {{ ship_date|date:"F j, Y" }}.</p>

	<p>Here are the items you've ordered:</p>

	<ul>
		{% for item_list %}
		<li>{{ item }}</li>
		{% endfor %}
	</ul>

	{% if ordered_warranty %}
		<p>Your warranty information will be included in the packaging.</p>
	{% else %}
		<p>You didn't order a warranty, so you're on your own when the products
			inevitably stop working.</p>
	{% end if %}

	<p>Sincerely, <br />{{ company }}</p>
